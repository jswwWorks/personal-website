<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm a recent college grad (B.A. in Philosophy and Biology) currently attending a Software Engineering bootcamp at Rithm School.
  <br><br>
  My professional experience thus far has been in teaching, communications, and game design. I decided to pursue software engineering after taking a Python course for fun.

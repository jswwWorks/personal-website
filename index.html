<div id="AboutMe">
  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I'm a recent college graduate (B.A. in Philosophy and Biology) and I'm a student in Rithm School's 35th cohort of its Software Engineering bootcamp.</p>

  <h4 id="blue">Profesional Experience</h4>
  <p>Most of my work experience is in teaching and communications. I worked most semesters in college as a tutor and TA in philosophy & STEM courses. In my final semester I worked for the UVM Biology Department in its pilot SciComm Internship, a program dedicated to improving the department's science communications. I have so much love for teaching and communications&mdash;for the longest time I wanted to be a philosophy professor, but I changed my mind once I realized how much I love to code.</p>

<h4 id="blue">The Switch to Tech</h4>
  <p>In my junior year of undergrad, I took my very first official coding course in Python. I decided to take it to try something new, expecting nothing to come from it. By the end of the course I tried to switch majors or add a minor, but I was too far into school to make the switch.</p>
  <p>The following summer, I was quarantined with COVID-19 and decided to learn by myself using free online resources. In my senior year I took more classes and soon after graduating I applied to Rithm School. It's just the beginning of my career but this change has been so fun, challenging, and rewarding!</p>
  <h4 id="blue">Just for Fun: Tabletop Game Design</h4>
  <p>My first summer job was interning at a local board game publisher. I worked there for three summers, and in my final summer I worked on the dev team for the board game <a href="https://www.northstargames.com/products/oceans"><i>Oceans</i></a>.</p>
  <p>During college I completed independent research in the Philosophy of Games and I started designing tabletop games of my own. My current project is called <a href="gnsSellSheet.pdf"><i>Galaxy Nail Salon</i></a>. The premise: compete with your fellow players to be the best manicurist in the galaxy! I've also participated in game jams for tabletop role playing games, which you can check out <a href="https://julesfordgames.itch.io">here</a>.</p>
